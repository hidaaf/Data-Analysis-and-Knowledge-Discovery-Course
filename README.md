# Data-Analysis-and-Knowledge-Discovery-Course

The following exercices were part of the TKO_3103 Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery course at the Universiy of Turku

## [Exercice 1](DAKD_2022_exercise_1.ipynb)
This exercise revolves around the data understanding and data preparation stages of the CRISP-DM model. It involves assessing data quality, potential issue identification, data cleaning and pre-processing, as well as data transformations for modeling purposes. The dataset used in this exercice contains information on hospital patients with and without cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease in this context refers to a condition characterized by the buildup of fatty deposits inside the heart's arteries.

## [Exercice 2](DAKD_2022_exercise_2.ipynb)
The second exercice builds on the learnings acquired in the first exercice and focuses on the modeling stage of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM). This involves performing supervised learning tasks, for both classification and regression, as well as model selection and evaluation. For the classification task, a pre-processed version of the dataset used in the previous exercise is utilized. For the regression task we used the Boston Housing Dataset, which contains information about housing in the Boston, Massachusetts area, collected by the U.S. Census Service.

## [Exercice 3](DAKD_2022_exercise_3.ipynb)
The purpose of the third and final exercise is to introduce the basics of unsupervised learning using the agglomerative hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering algorithms to identify patterns in the data. The dataset used in this exercise is a simplified and downsampled version of the KDD Cup 1999 Dataset, featuring samples of network activity simulated in a military network environment. We note different types of activity: normal activity, and 3 types of malicious activity (denial of service, unauthorized remote login, and network probing (e.g. port scanning)).
